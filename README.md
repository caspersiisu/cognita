# Cognita SDK

Cognita SDK is an AI-driven research workflow tool that empowers users to automate the discovery, synthesis, and summarization of scientific research. By interfacing with the Deep Research API, the SDK streamlines the process of gathering and processing research data.

## Features

- **AI Agent:** Seamlessly manage research queries and workflows.
- **API Integration:** Retrieve up-to-date research data via the Deep Research API.
- **Configuration Management:** Easily manage API settings with environment variables.
- **Utility Functions:** Validate queries, format API responses, and summarize research results.
- **Logging:** Integrated logging for robust debugging and monitoring.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/caspersiisu/cognita.git
   cd cognita
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```ini
   API_BASE_URL=https://api.research.com/v1
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   API_TIMEOUT=30
   MAX_RESULTS=10
   MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.7
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Quickstart

Below is a simple example to get you started quickly with Cognita SDK:

```python
from cognita import Config, CognitaAgent

def main():
    # Load configuration from environment variables
    config = Config()
    
    # Initialize the Cognita Agent
    agent = CognitaAgent(config)
    
    # Define a research query
    query = "Describe recent advancements in renewable energy technologies."
    
    # Execute the research query
    results = agent.execute_query(query)
    
    # Display the results
    print("Research Query Results:")
    print(results)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the SDK, execute a research query, and print the summarized results to the console.
